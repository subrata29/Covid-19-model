# Covid-19-model
This code is used to simulate the model mentioned in a paper "Modeling Spread of Contagious Disease by Temporally Stochastic Cellular Automata". 
Run the simulator as follow:
-- Keep model.py and graph.py in same folder.
-- Run model.py first, which creates two text files "infection.txt" and "vaccinated.txt".
-- Run graph.py, which  is used to create graphs.
